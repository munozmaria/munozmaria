### Hi, I'm Maria 👋

## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 🐾  
I'm a **web and mobile developer** based in **Paris, France 🇫🇷🗼**. Currently, I'm working on a **contrat de professionnalisation**, and I decided to transition into development after several years of working closely with hotel directors. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to create useful applications, and one of my most impactful projects is **QRStock**. I built it entirely by myself for my company to improve stock management through QR code scanning, alerts, and automation.
